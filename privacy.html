      <p>
        Pisi is committed to the protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis
        on which Pisi collects and uses personal information about you as part of our business activities. This
        Privacy Policy describes in detail who is responsible for the personal information that Pisi collects
        about you, what personal information is collected, how PISI uses such personal information, who PISI
        may disclose it to, and your rights and choices in relation to your personal information. This Privacy Policy
        generally covers information collected on the app and the website <a href="https://www.pisimobile.net" target="_blank">www.pisimobile.net</a> but also
        relates to information collected by PISI outside of the PISI Website.

      <h3>WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT PISI COLLECTS?</h3>
      <p>
        For the purposes of data protection law, PISI is the data controller as to the personal information that is
        collected and used as part of its business activities. This is because PISI dictates the purpose for which
        your personal information is used and how PISI uses your personal information.
      </p>

      <h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES PISI COLLECT?</h3>
      <p>
        While some of the information collected is required for business engagement purposes, other
        information is voluntarily given by you. The type of personal information that PISI may collect could
        include, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your full name, address, phone, fax, and email contact information</li>
        <li>Payment information</li>
        <li>Preference information, such as the communications you receive from us</li>
        <li>Information you provide to us for meetings, events, webinars, and programs</li>
        <li>Any other information you may provide (including for third parties with their consent)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are providing personal information to PISI relating to a third party, you confirm that you have the
        consent of the third party to share such personal information with PISI and that you have made the
        information in this Privacy Policy available to the third party.

      <h3>SENSITIVE CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>
        Some countries consider some personal information particularly sensitive. PISI only collects this data when
        voluntarily given by the individual and for statistical purposes only. PISI does not share this information
        with third parties for business purposes. Such information may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date of birth</li>
        <li>Ethnicity, nationality, gender, and other demographic information</li>

      <h3>HOW DOES PISI OBTAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        As noted above, we collect information from you in the course of your use of the PISI Website. For <br>
        example, PISI collects information from you when you contact or communicate with PISI (including <br>
        through the PISI Website, by email, or otherwise). PISI also collects your personal information while <br>
        monitoring the PISI Website. PISI also gathers information about you when you provide it to us or <br>
        interact with us directly.

    <section>
      <h3>WHO DOES PISI SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?</h3>
      <p>
        PISI reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party, if PISI has <br>
        reason to believe that disclosing personal information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal <br>
        action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or <br>
        unintentionally) PISI rights or property, other PISI Website users or anyone else who could be harmed <br>
        by such activities. Additionally, PISI may disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, <br>
        warrant, or other court order, or when PISI believes in good faith that a law, regulation, subpoena, <br>
        warrant, or other court order requires it.
        PISI reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of <br>
        proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure, or repossession), <br>
        lease, merger, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or <br>
        financing of all or any portion of PISI.
        PISI may share your information with personal advisors, such as accountants and lawyers, who assist us <br>
        in carrying out our business activities. PISI may share personal information with third parties engaged <br>
        to assist PISI in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. <br>
        These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other <br>
        than to provide this assistance and are contractually required to protect personal information <br>
        disclosed by PISI and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
        If you choose not to provide PISI with your personal information, you may still visit the PISI Website. <br> 
        However, you may be unable to access certain website options, so use the PISI Website functionality to <br>
        its fullest extent.

      <h3>TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACROSS BORDERS</h3>
      <p>
        ‍Pisi is a global organization. PISI may allow your personal information to be shared with its related <br>
        entities or third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. <br>
        This may entail a transfer of your information from a location within the EEA to outside the EEA, or from <br>
        outside the EEA to a location within the EEA.
        When PISI provides your personal information in such instances, such is done in connection with <br>
        providing you requested information or services, or as required or authorized under law. It is possible <br>
        the overseas entities to which PISI shares your information may not be subject to laws that provide the <br>
        same level of protection of information as your country of residence, or may not be subject to any <br>
        privacy obligations. Overseas entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal <br>
        information to a third party, such as an overseas authority. Where we transfer information outside of <br>
        the EEA, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains <br>
        protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Unfortunately, the <br>
        transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although PISI uses reasonable <br>
        efforts to protect your personal information, it cannot guarantee the security of your personal <br>
        information transmitted to the PISI Website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once PISI has <br>
        received your personal information, it will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security <br>
        features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

        such website.
        PISI is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites, and the privacy practices <br>
        employed by such sites may not be the same as PISI’s practices. As with the PISI Website, you should <br>
        become familiar with any external party’s privacy policy before visiting and/or providing any personal <br>
        information through any such site. PISI may terminate access for any party who is found to repeatedly <br>
        provide or post protected material without necessary rights and permissions.
